# MaxDNet
 This Python tool (in development) provides reachability-analysis-based discrepancy computation between two similar deep neural networks. The operations supported by this tool currently are convolution, max pooling, fully connected, and ReLU.
 # Related tools and software
 The network structure and computation are based on PyTorch. The reachability representation of images is based on ImageStar in the NNV tool ([NNV](https://github.com/verivital/nnv))
# Installation:
1) Clone the repo.
2) Install all required dependencies.
3) Run discrepancy exp.py for the discrepancy experiment result.
4) Run repair exp.py for the restoration experiment result.
